# Cryptography Project
This program will encrypt and decrypt a message using RSA. The user can experiment with various parameters, such as bitsize and blocksize.

Notable features of this program include, but are not limited to primality testing (Sieve of Erathosthenes, Miller-Rabin), 2-prime & multi-prime RSA, and hash functions.

WARNING: Hashing will only be allowed on 8-bit character strings!

Run Command: `python cryptography_project.py`
